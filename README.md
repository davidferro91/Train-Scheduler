## Description
Displaying a Train Schedule via Firebase

This is a working example of how data can be stored on Firebase to be displayed across multiple browsers.  The idea behind it is that there is a schedule of trains that the user can check at any time, and it will tell them when the next train will arrive and how many minutes away it is.

The user is also able to add new trains to the schedule via the form at the bottom of the page.  The user needs to input the name, the destination, the initial arrival time, and how frequently the train runs.

The page regenerates the data every 30 seconds, so that the user can open the page once, and know how long it will take for the train to come without doing a page refresh.

Update and delete buttons haven't been added yet, but they might be soon!

Enjoy!
